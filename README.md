# Solar Radiation Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements a solar radiation prediction model using machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor. The code processes solar data, performs feature selection based on variance, and evaluates model performance.

## Purpose
The README provides essential information about the project, helping users understand its purpose, installation, usage, and collaboration opportunities.

## Target Audience
This README is intended for anyone working on a programming project, particularly those who want others to use or contribute to their code.

## Timing for Creation
It is best to create a README before showcasing your project or making it public. Establishing the README early in the project development can help clarify goals and usage.

## File Location
Place the README file in the top-level directory of the project. This ensures that newcomers can easily find it. Code hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab will display the README alongside your project files.

## Formatting Guidelines
- While READMEs can be written in various formats, the most common format used nowadays is Markdown due to its lightweight formatting capabilities.
- You can learn more about Markdown at the [CommonMark website](https://commonmark.org/).
- Use any text editor to create your README; many editors have plugins for Markdown preview.
- Dedicated Markdown editors or online tools can also be utilized.

## Project Details
- **Dependencies:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly`
  - `scikit-learn`
  
- **Data File:**
  - Place the `SolarPrediction.csv` file in the specified directory for the code to work correctly.
